# btv-resources

This repository contains a map of resources available to the community in so-called Burlington, Vermont. The .sla file is used for [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/downloads/stable-branch/), a free, open source page layout tool. 

The map can be found in [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1ft0EvAna_takcvPFZ3g-kzyUcLvK57Ey&usp=sharing). I'm not sure how to make it openly editable, so for now submit an issue in the issues tab of this repository and I'll make the neceesary change.
